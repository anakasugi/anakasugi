- 👋 Hi, I’m @anakasugi
  - I’m still very new to everything programming - only realizing how fun (and incredibly frustrating at times) dabbling in code can be when I crashed into it 
    face first in grad school.
  - Trying my best with writing readable code from the start, but as there is no-one to give feedback atm, please don't mind if what I upload is quite crude.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, first and foremost! 
  - Hope to some day be able to expand to php, java, ruby... python would be of course also good to grasp the basics in as it's maybe a bit more widely used than R?   
- 👀  interested in data visualization and overall "making sense of data". Nothing beats a good graph when it comes to concise information delivery!
- 💞️ Please feel free to holler, and point out mistakes and ways to improve anything I've uploaded here - it will be sincerely appreciated!
- 📫 I won't log in daily, or even weekly, but I will do so eventually :)

Cheers!
